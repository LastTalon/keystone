**Keystone** is a _[Roblox]_ collections library for [roblox-ts]. It is the
successor to [Monolith].

Data structures and abstract data types make managing data simple.

- Use collections such as Lists, Queues, and Sets
- Easily build collections of data
- Utilize enumeration to transform data
- Stop focusing on the plumbing

## Installation

Keystone can be installed in a [roblox-ts] project by adding it to your
`package.json`.

```
npm install @rbxts/keystone
```

You can then sync or build your project with [Rojo].

In the future we plan to support installation through [Wally].
